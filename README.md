Projects for me to practice
For  the first SQL project 'Afganistan Covid Analyssi', to be hoest, this is not a good finished work due to importing large files into mysql workbench problems. In the future, if I can figure it out, I will come back to complete this project again.

For the second Excel project 'Bike Sales Dashborad', This project aims to create an Excel dashboard that analyzes the bike purchase behavior of people from different age groups, education levels, and genders in various regions around the world. The analysis focuses on factors such as average income per year, age, and commute distance to understand the preferences and trends related to bike purchases.
