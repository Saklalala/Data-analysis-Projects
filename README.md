Projects for me to practice as the beginner

For the second Excel project 'Bike Sales Dashborad', This project aims to create an Excel dashboard that analyzes the bike purchase behavior of people from different age groups, education levels, and genders in various regions around the world. The analysis focuses on factors such as average income per year, age, and commute distance to understand the preferences and trends related to bike purchases.


For the Airbnb Data Visualization Dashboard, this dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listing prices and revenue trends across different factors such as bedroom count, zip codes, and time periods. The visualizations help uncover insights into pricing patterns and revenue performance aiming to help users understand how location, bedroom count, and time impact Airbnb pricing and revenue
